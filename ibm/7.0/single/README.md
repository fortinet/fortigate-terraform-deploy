# Deployment of a FortiGate-VM  on the IBM Cloud
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM on IBM Cloud

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider IBM >= 1.12.0
  Needs to install the IBM Provider pluging following the link [IBM Setup](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-getting-started)
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.1.2


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - IBM VPC with 2 subnets
   - One FortiGate-VM instance with 2 NICs
   - One security group with inbound and outbound rules

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to IBM cloud:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

FGTPublicIP = <FGT Public IP>
Password = <FGT Password>
Username = admin

```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
