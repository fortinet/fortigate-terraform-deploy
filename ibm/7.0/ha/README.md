# Deployment of FortiGate-VMs HA (a-p)  on the IBM Cloud
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy FortiGate-VMs HA (a-p) on IBM Cloud

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.9
* Terraform Provider IBM >= 1.36.0
  Needs to install the IBM Provider pluging following the link [IBM Setup](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-getting-started)
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - IBM VPC with 3 subnets - public, private and hasync
   - Two FortiGate-VM instances with 3 NICs
   - One security group with inbound and outbound rules
   - One floating IP for Public IP failing over.
   - One public Gateways for public subnets in the VPC.
   - Two FortiGate-VM instances which will be preconfigured with the necessary ip configurations, ha settings, and sdn connector settings.
   - One route table associated with private subnet with egress route to the private port of active FortiGate-VM.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM HA (a-p) on the IBM cloud:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

FGTPublicIP = <FGT Public IP>
Password = <FGT Password>
Username = admin

```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
