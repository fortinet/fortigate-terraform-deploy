# Deployment of a FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG)  on the AWS
## -- DRAFT --
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM with ZTNA configuration on AWS into existing VPC

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.0
* Terraform Provider AWS >= 3.63.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* Existing VPC with two subnets.


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - One FortiGate-VM instance with 2 NICs
   - Two Network Security Group rules: one for external, one for internal.
   - Two Route tables: one for internal subnet and one for external subnet.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to AWS:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
FGTGUIURL = "<FGT GUI Login>"                                                                                                                                                                                             
FGTZTNAURL = "<FGT ZTNA GUI Login>"
LocalUsername = "<Local ZTNA Test Username>"
LocalUserpassword = "<Local ZTNA Test User Password>"
Password = "<FGT Password>"
Username = "<FGT Username>"
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
