# Deployment of a Azure VWAN on Azure
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a Azure VWan and VPN connection with on-premise FortiGate.

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM >= 2.87.0
* Terraform Provider FortiOS >= 1.13.2
* FortiGate API Key for configuration.


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - Azure Virtual Network with 2 subnets
   - Azure VWan
   - Azure VWan Hub
   - Azure VPN Site with connection to On-Premise FortiGate
   - Azure VWan virtual network connections to a virtual network
   - Configuring the IPSEC, BGP and related configurations to the On-Premise FortiGate

## Deployment
To deploy the topology to Azure:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

azurerm_vpn_gateway_id = "XXXXXX"
azurerm_vpn_tunnel2_private_ip = "X.X.X.X"                                                                                                    
azurerm_vpn_tunnel2_public_ip = "X.X.X.X"                                          
azurerm_vpn_tunnel_private_ip = "X.X.X.X"                               
azurerm_vpn_tunnel_public_ip = "X.X.X.X"    
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```

## Verify the deployment
After deployment, the BGP route should be populate via the ipsec tunnel
```
get router info routing-table  details
