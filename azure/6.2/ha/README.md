# Deployment of a FortiGate-VM (PAYG) Cluster on Azure
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM Cluster on Azure

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM 2.6.0
* Terraform Provider Template 2.1.2
* Terraform Provider Random 2.2.1


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - An Azure Virtual Network with 4 subnets
   - Two FortiGate-VM (PAYG) instances with four NICs.
   - Two firewall rules.
   - An Ubuntu Client instance.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Azure:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars` and `variables.tf` file as needed.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

ActiveMGMTPublicIP = <Active FGT Management Public IP>
ClusterPublicIP = <Cluster Public IP>
PassiveMGMTPublicIP = <Passive FGT Management Public IP>
Password = <FGT Password>
ResourceGroup = <Resource Group>
Username = <FGT admin>
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```

## Requirements and limitations

The terms for the FortiGate PAYG image in the Azure Marketplace needs to be accepted once before usage. This is done automatically during deployment via the Azure Portal. For the Azure CLI the commands below need to be run before the first deployment in a subscription.

```sh
PAYG az vm image terms accept --publisher fortinet --offer fortinet_fortigate-vm_v5 --plan fortinet_fg-vm_payg_20190624
```
